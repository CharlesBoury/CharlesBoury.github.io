    <h2>Hello! ‚òòÔ∏è</h2>
    <p>I'm a game artist with eight years of experience.<br>
    I make interactive pictures to expose complex rules and dream of a better future.<br>
    I worked with different teams on award-winning games, and shipped half a dozen finished products.</p>


    <h3>What I can bring to your team</h3>
    <p>My core strength is graphic production with photoshop and blender, and lively scene setting in Unity. I craft polished, detailed animated screens as well as quick game mockups. I can set and follow an artistic direction that will be beautiful and memorable.</p>

    <p>I have a lot of experience with designing and illustrating educational video games, finding an effective mix between fun and content. I see videogames as an invaluable tool to explore complex systems. I have an immense respect for the human that will play my games, and therefore spent time looking at how to best explain something. I bring informed point of view to the design team on gameplay, UX, and tone.</p>

    <p>As an amateur programmer, I speak their language. I know how to make a game, down to the compiler. As a consequence, I understand what the console log is saying, I see through the matrix of text-serialized Unity scenes, and I know how to tame git. I take care of my tools, and am eager to help others. I have been in the position of technical artist in several teams. I'm pleased when there's generative coding or hand-written shaders on the menu.</p>


    <h3>What I'm looking for</h3>
    <p>I'm looking for fulfilling visual design work where I can be part of a small, fun team creating interactive experiences. I don't want to be too prescriptive about what that might be, be here are some things I seek.</p>

    <h3>I'm happiest when...</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>working on projects that genuinely help people and society</li>
        <li>working on site, fulltime, with a small, technically competent team</li>
        <li>collaborating with a caring, inclusive group of people</li>
        <li>working iteratively to get to the intended goal</li>
        <li>contributing to the why and what we're making</li>
        <li>crafting effective gameplay and excellence in visuals</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As for style and aesthetic, mine is versatile and subjected to the project, but I thrive when there's a contemplative world to give birth to.</p>

    <h3>Availability</h3>
    <p>I'm currently booked until spring, working for Ikigai as their Artistic Director, creating educational games at Sorbonne university.<br>
    I'm always interested to hear of new opportunities, so please <a href="mailto:boury.charles@gmail.com">get in touch</a>! I'm very much up for meetings and chats over coffee about possible projects.</p>
