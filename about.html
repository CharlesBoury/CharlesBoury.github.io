    <h2>Hello! ‚òòÔ∏è</h2>
    <p>I‚Äôm a visual artist and creative coder.<br>
    I make interactive pictures to expose complex rules and dream of a better future.<br>
    I worked with different teams on award&#8209;winning games, and shipped half a dozen finished products.</p>


    <h3>What I can bring to your team</h3>
    <p>My core strength is graphic production with Photoshop and Blender, and lively scene setting with Unity. I craft polished, detailed animated screens as well as quick game mockups. I set and follow an artistic direction that will be appealing and memorable.</p>

    <p>I have a lot of experience with designing and illustrating video games, finding an effective mix between fun and content. I see videogames as an invaluable tool to explore complex systems. Because I respect the time of people that will play my games, I spend time looking at how to best convey something. I bring informed point of view to the design team on gameplay, user experience, and tone.</p>

    <p>As a creative coder, I know how to make a game, down to the compiler. As a consequence, I understand what the console log is saying, I see through the matrix of text&#8209;serialized Unity scenes, and I know how to tame Git. I take care of my tools, and am eager to help others. I have been in the position of technical artist in several teams. I'm pleased when there's generative coding or hand&#8209;written shaders on the menu.</p>


    <h3>What I'm looking for</h3>
    <p>I'm looking for fulfilling visual design work where I can be part of a nice team creating interactive experiences. I don't want to be too prescriptive about what that might be, but here are some things I seek.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>working on projects that genuinely help people and society</li>
        <li>crafting effective gameplay and excellence in visuals</li>
        <li>working fulltime with a technically competent team</li>
        <li>collaborating with a caring, inclusive group of people</li>
        <li>contributing to the why and what we're making</li>
        <li>working iteratively to get to the intended goal</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As for style/aesthetic, mine is multiple and subjected to the project. I thrive when there's a contemplative world to give birth to.</p>

    <h3>Availability</h3>
    <p>I‚Äôm open for every new experience in artistic direction and creative coding.<br>
    I'm always interested to hear of new opportunities, so please <a href="mailto:boury.charles@gmail.com">get in touch</a>! I'm very much up for meetings and chats over coffee about possible projects.</p>
